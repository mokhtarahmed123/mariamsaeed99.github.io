            </span>
            Originally built on the site of an old mausoleum, local and foreign merchants have been trading at Khan el-Khalili souk since the 14th century. It is Egypt's most famous market.

            Established in the 14th century, the Khan El-Khalili market in Cairo has a rich and fascinating history, making it an important district for both cultural and economic activity. This historic bazaar has been a hub of trade and commerce for centuries, showcasing the enduring traditions of Egyptian craftsmanship and merchant culture. Stepping into Khan El-Khalili is like taking a journey back in time, where you can immerse yourself in the history of this bustling marketplace and explore its intricate alleyways, lined with stalls offering a wide array of goods, from intricate jewelry to colorful textiles and aromatic spices.

        <h3>
            What to see
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are a great number of cultural and historic structures in Khan El-Khalili, so it’s no surprise the area has been featured in many movies and literary works such as Naguib Mafhouz’s novel Midaq Alley. Once you’re there, you’ll be steps from Muizz Street which has many examples of medieval Islamic architecture. You’re also close to Al-Hussein Mosque as well as Wekalet El Ghouri and Al-Azhar market. It’s like stepping back in time to medieval Cairo.

                Shopping
            </h3>
        <p>
            While the souk is no longer strictly divided into specific trading areas, the gold merchants, coppersmiths', and spice vendors' districts remain quite distinct. Throughout the rest of the bazaar, stalls are full of colourful lanterns, candles, jewellery, perfumes, musical instruments and other handicrafts - you can pretty much find anything you could possibly want within its walls!  
        <br>
            This is a great place to shop for souvenirs - most vendors speak some English and you can try out your haggling skills and a few words of Arabic (see our General Information on travelling to Egypt for tips)! Even if you don't want to buy anything, the market is an incredible place to walk through and experience the craziness of daily life in Cairo. Most stalls are open from around 9 am until well after nightfall - although some may be closed on Friday mornings and Sundays.

            Where to eat and drink
        </h3>
        <p>
            After tiring yourself out exploring the shops and stalls, you won't need to go far for a well-earned break. The souk is also home to a number of restaurants, street food vendors and small but very traditional coffeehouses - called maqha in Arabic. Frequented by locals and tourists alike, here you can sit down and enjoy an Arabic coffee - often brewed with spices like cardamom - or a karkade, a sweet hibiscus tea, and smoke shisha from a hookah, Like:

            <li>El-Dahhan</li>

            best time for your vist
        </h3>
        
        <P>
            You’ll be guaranteed a fresh experience if you’re lucky enough to visit the market at the same time as the Mawlid Al-Hussein, a Sufi celebration of Imam Hussein’s birth. During this time, Sufists perform litanies and take part in other traditional activities. A few steps away you’ll find Wekalet El- Ghouri where you can enjoy another type of Sufi spiritual activity, the Tannoura show. Carnivals take place in Muizz Street every now and then, too.

        <h3>
            how to get there
        </h3>
        <p>
            As Khan El Khalili Market is located in the heart of Cairo, it isn’t hard to follow one of the public transportation routes to get there. If you want to save yourself the hassle, order an Uber or take a taxi. The metro is one of the easiest means, just reach Ataba Station and you’re almost there. From Ataba you’ll be minutes away, so you can either walk, take a taxi or jump in one of the micro-buses right in front of the station. You can also take a bus from Ramses station or Tahrir Square.
