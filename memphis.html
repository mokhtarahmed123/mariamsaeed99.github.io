                <h1>Introduction:</h1>
                <p>Ancient Memphis, or "Ineb Hedj" in ancient Egyptian, flourished as the capital of Egypt during the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150–2686 BCE) and throughout much of the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE). Founded by the legendary King Menes, who unified Upper and Lower Egypt, Memphis symbolized the consolidation of Egypt's power and the dawn of a new era.</p>
